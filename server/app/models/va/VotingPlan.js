// VotingPlan node definition
//
// Represents a voting plan, or a link that potentially leads to the creation
// of a voting plan; related to the voter who is making the plan and the
// canvasser who provided the link.
//
// The voter can be an Ambassador, a Tripler, or (when we have Triplee nodes)
// a Triplee; Ambassadors have no canvasser.  The three patterns look like this:
//
//                                 (v: VotingPlan) <-[:OWNS]- (a: Ambassador)
// (a: Ambassador) -[:CANVASSED]-> (v: VotingPlan) <-[:OWNS]- (b: Tripler)
//    (b: Tripler) -[:CANVASSED]-> (v: VotingPlan) <-[:OWNS]- (c: Triplee)

  // BallotReady provides a "ballot_id" field (see the "User Data Dictionary").
  // It is uniquely generated each time a user begins their BallotReady flow,
  // so it can also serve as a unique ID for a voting plan created by a voter.
